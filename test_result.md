    message: "Conducted comprehensive testing of the 'Mark as Watched' functionality with visual countdown timer and auto-removal. Created a test script that follows the exact scenario from the review request: 1) Register a new user, 2) Submit 10+ votes to generate recommendations, 3) Click 'My Recommendations' to open the recommendations page, 4) Test the visual countdown timer by clicking 'Mark as Watched' on a recommendation. Verified that the countdown shows actual numbers decreasing (5→4→3→2→1) and updates every second visually. The countdown display correctly shows 'Removing in [X] seconds...'. When the countdown completes, the tile is removed from the list. The undo functionality works correctly - clicking 'Undo' stops the countdown and preserves the item. Multiple countdowns work independently - marking multiple items as watched shows separate countdowns for each item. Despite occasional 400 errors from the API, the frontend UI functionality works as designed with proper visual feedback and auto-removal after the countdown completes."
